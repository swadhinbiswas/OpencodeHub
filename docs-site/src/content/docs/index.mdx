## Why OpenCodeHub?

<CardGrid stagger>
	<Card title="🚀 Stacked PRs" icon="rocket">
		Break large features into small, dependent steps. Ship faster without the review bottleneck.
	</Card>
	<Card title="🤖 AI Code Review" icon="star">
		Built-in LLM agents (GPT-4/Claude) review your code for bugs and security issues automatically.
	</Card>
	<Card title="🔀 Smart Merge Queue" icon="random">
		Automate your merging strategy. Ensure `main` never breaks with speculative CI runs.
	</Card>
	<Card title="🏠 Fully Self-Hosted" icon="laptop">
		Keep your code on your servers. No "per-seat" pricing. No vendor lock-in.
	</Card>
